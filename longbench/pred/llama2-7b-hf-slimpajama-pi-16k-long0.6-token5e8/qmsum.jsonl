{"pred": "The working design of the remote control involves a portable device that sends messages to the main device, such as a TV, using infrared or sensor technology. The device has an energy source (battery), user interface (buttons and keypad), a digital signal processing chip, and an infrared LED source. The remote control can be trained to recognize specific words (e.g., volume up, down, channel eight) and can be used to control power, volume, and channel selection. The remote control can also be equipped with a speech recognizer, but it is not feasible to implement automatic on/off control due to the cost and complexity.
